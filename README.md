# Google-location-mileage
Takes Google Semantic location history and exports a list of mileage between the start and finish point of each location. 

This will scan for any json file in the same folder as the script, and will look at all of them. 
Note, you need to use the Semantic Location History files. 

This does NOT go off of the route you actually took, but the google maps reccommended route between start and finish point. 

This does require you to use the google API. 

I use this for exporting my drives for mileage logging reasons.
